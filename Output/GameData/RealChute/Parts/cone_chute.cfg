	description = After Bob almost splattered against the walls of a descending capsule whose instantly-deploying, one-size fits all parachute ripped off, he demanded change. KSC ignored his demand, citing cost, until he returned with a BACC, a lighter, and an empty bottle of Scotch. Terrified, KSC engineers invented the Real Chute, which is highly configurable gradually deploys.
