	description = After Bill nearly met fiery doom because his Real Chute could not stop his capsule's screaming descent, he demanded change. KSC ignored his demand, citing cost, until he strapped some spare boosters from Jebediah's Junkyard onto his car and flew into the boardroom one afternoon, terrorizing the already traumatized directors with savage screams and his wafer-thin heatshield. KSC engineers hastily added a drogue chute to their otherwise successful Real Chute design.
