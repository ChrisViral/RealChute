Please COMPLETELY DELETE any previous RealChute installation before installing
a new version. Not doing so could corrupt save files, craft files, or break
different aspects of the game. I am *not* responsible if you do not delete it
the previous install and break something.

NOTE: AS OF KSP 1.1, REALCHUTE NO LONGER IS LOCKED ON THE WINDOWS 64BIT BUILDS.
THIS IS HOWEVER POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND SUPPORT FOR THOSE BUILDS AS WELL
AS THE OSX 64BIT BUILD MAY BE REVERTED AT ANY MOMENT, AND THIS, ENTIRELY UP TO MY
OWN DISCRETION.

v0.3.2
KSP 0.23 compatibility update!
-Added combo chutes which contain both a drogue and a main for soft landings in one part
-Added the ability to define a second material for the second parachute
-Added the ability to force the parachutes partially in one direction, thus eliminating clipping chutes on dual parts!

-Parachutes no create drag from the very area where they originate from. This means a chute on the side will hang realistically without a CoM offset

-Parachutes are now made of different materials, defined in cfg files
-Parachute canopies now weight something which depends on which material they are made of and what is it's area density
