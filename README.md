# RealChute
RealChute is a complete rework of the stock KSP parachute module to fix a few of its inconveniences and get more realistic results out of parachutes!

## Features
- Gradual deployment: Chutes gradually deploy, increasing realism and decreasing deployment shock.
- New Deployment Conditions: Chutes deploy in conditions ranging from Eve's crushing clouds to Duna's silken veil. Parachutes deploy either according to atmospheric density or altitude and will not deploy when not intended to; e.g. in space or on the pad. Autocuts can be set for a certain altitude per chute to cut some chutes while other deploy!
- Parachutes on Ground: Parachutes will not autocut upon nearly stopping mid-air or touching the ground, enabling drag chutes for planes!
- Parachutes Return to Staging: Parachutes can be restaged again and again without restrictions!
- Drag Chute: Drag chutes deploy at low altitude to slow landing airplanes.
- Full Customization: Parachutes' values can be edited, and modders can add the plugin to their packs.
- Combo Chute: Deploys a drogue and next a main chute.
- Custom parts: sumghai gave this pack its own parts!
- Vessel Hangs from Chute: Even nose chutes!
- Editor window: Edit parachutes from the editor for any shape, size, or characteristics!
- Presets: Quickly edit parachutes by saving configurations into presets and loading them quickly later!

## General Notes
This mod is no longer in active development and has been on life support for quite a while. I release some fixes and patches here and there as necessary for other mod compatibility, but features are no longer being written.
This mod was written when I was a very young and naive programmer, and some mistakes in code architecture are just too spaghetti'd to simply fix.
I'm working on a rewrite of the mod that would solve these issues and add a lot of new features, but I will not be saying much about it until it is nearing release.
